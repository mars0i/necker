### A Necker cube constraint satisfaction model

This is a simple "constraint satisfaction" neural network model of a
perceptual process for interpreting a 2-D image known as a Necker cube
as three-dimensional (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necker_cube). The
model was inspired by a description in"Schemata and Sequential Thought
Processes in PDP Models" D. E. Rumelhart, P. Smolensky, J. 1. McClelland
and G. E. Hinton, chapter 14 in *Parallel Distributed Processing, Vol.
2: Psychological and Biological Models*, eds. James L. McLelland, David
E. Rumelhart.
(cf. Holyoak and Thagard *Mental Leaps* (1995) chapter 10.)
